# Financial-Models
This is a collection of financial models written in Python as a chance to develop my quantitative analysis skills of the financial markets.
Models include:
- Time Series Model -- ARIMA to forecast volatility or returns
- Factor Model -- Fama-French 3/5 -- Factor Model used to analyze equity returns based on market size, value, momentum

There are also models that I will implement in the future, including but not limited to:
- Option Pricing -- Black-Scholes Model
- Portfolio Optimization -- Markowitz Mean-Variance, developing my visualizations of frontier
- Statistical Arbitage -- you can use PCA
- Machine Learning Model -- utilise XGBoost
